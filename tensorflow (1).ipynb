    "## Different Data Structures in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow uses several data structures to represent and manipulate tensors, which are the fundamental building blocks in TensorFlow. Here are some of the main data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tensor**: The primary data structure in TensorFlow, representing multi-dimensional arrays. Tensors can be scalars (0D), vectors (1D), matrices (2D), or higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constant**: A tensor with fixed values that cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variable**: A tensor with modifiable values that can be updated during training. Variables are often used for model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Placeholder**: Deprecated in TensorFlow 2.0 and later. Previously used to feed data into a computational graph. Superseded by the `tf.data` API for input pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SparseTensor**: A tensor optimized for representing sparse data, where most of the elements are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **RaggedTensor**: A tensor with non-uniform dimensions along a given axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **StringTensor**: A tensor containing strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Dataset**: A data structure used to represent a sequence of elements, typically used for loading and preprocessing data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow Constant vs Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Constant**: A TensorFlow constant is a tensor with fixed values that remain unchanged after creation. Once you define the constant, its values cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a TensorFlow constant\n",
    "constant = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will raise an error as constants are immutable\n",
    "# constant[0] = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Variable**: A TensorFlow variable is a tensor with modifiable values that can be updated during training using operations like assignment. Variables are often used to represent model parameters that need optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating a TensorFlow variable\n",
    "initial_value = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 2))\n",
    "variable = tf.Variable(initial_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the value of the variable\n",
    "new_value = tf.random.normal(shape=(2, 2))\n",
    "variable.assign(new_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix Operations in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Addition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating two matrices\n",
    "A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matrix addition\n",
    "C = tf.add(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Matrix A:\")\n",
    "print(A.numpy())\n",
    "print(\"Matrix B:\")\n",
    "print(B.numpy())\n",
    "print(\"Matrix C (A + B):\")\n",
    "print(C.numpy())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Matrix multiplication\n",
    "D = tf.matmul(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Matrix D (A * B):\")\n",
    "print(D.numpy())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element-wise Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "E = tf.multiply(A, B)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Matrix E (Element-wise A * B):\")\n",
    "print(E.numpy())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise square\n",
    "F = tf.square(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Matrix F (Element-wise square of A):\")\n",
    "print(F.numpy())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, matrix operations and element-wise operations are performed using various functions such as `tf.add`, `tf.matmul`, `tf.multiply`, and `tf.square`, among others. These operations can be applied to tensors of compatible shapes, enabling efficient computation in deep learning models."
